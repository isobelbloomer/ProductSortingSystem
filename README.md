# ProductSortingSystem - C

This is a C program that reads in text files data and uses circular queues to merge the data into one list by order of weight for a car parts company.

This project received **100%** in Algorithm Design at TU Dublin.

## How it works
- The program reads in lists of data from 4 text files.
- It uses circular queues to sort data from 4 seperate files into 1 list, ordered by weight.
- All functionality is implemented in a single file (`main.c`).

## Files
- `Main.c` → main program
- `line1.txt`, `line2.txt`, `line3.txt`, `line4.txt` → sample input files

## How to run

gcc Main.c -o Main
./Main
